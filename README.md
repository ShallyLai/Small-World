Goal: Study the Properties of "Small World" and Compare Different Data Structures
1. Generate a cycle of 1000 nodes. Each edge has length 1.
2. Add x random edges. Each random edge has the same length y.
3. Sample z pairs of source and destination and compute the average shortest distance (d) of these z source-destination pairs.
4. Draw a graph where x = 100.
